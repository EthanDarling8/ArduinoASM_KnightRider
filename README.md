# ArduinoASM_KnightRider
Little thing I did to get six led lights to light up like the car in the old show Knight Rider. 

- Written completely in Assembly.

- Compiled on linux using AVRA and AVRDUDES. 
- Works with Arduino Uno R3 (m328Pdef.inc).

- Original project inspiration was from the for loop iteration example using C.
- You can find the link to the example here https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ForLoopIteration?from=Tutorial.ForLoop.
- Example includes images on how to wire up the circuit.
